# PNPM Lockfile Fix - January 2025

## Issue Fixed
GitHub Actions was failing with the error:
```
ERR_PNPM_NO_LOCKFILE Cannot install with "frozen-lockfile" because pnpm-lock.yaml is absent
```

## Root Cause
The project was configured to use pnpm (as specified in `package.json` with `"packageManager": "pnpm@9.1.0"`), but:
1. Development was done using `npm install`, creating a `package-lock.json`
2. No `pnpm-lock.yaml` file existed in the repository
3. GitHub Actions workflows expected pnpm with frozen lockfile installation

According to the [pnpm documentation](https://pnpm.io/errors), the `ERR_PNPM_NO_LOCKFILE` error occurs when:
> Cannot install with "frozen-lockfile" because pnpm-lock.yaml is absent

## Changes Made

### 1. Generated pnpm Lockfile
```bash
# Removed npm artifacts
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Generated pnpm lockfile
pnpm install
```

### 2. Updated Documentation
- Updated `SETUP.md` to use pnpm commands instead of npm
- Ensured `.gitignore` doesn't exclude `pnpm-lock.yaml`

### 3. Verified Functionality
- ✅ `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` works correctly
- ✅ Build process works with pnpm
- ✅ All dependencies installed properly

## Benefits of Using pnpm

According to the search results and [pnpm documentation](https://www.bstefanski.com/blog/how-to-fix-cannot-install-with-frozen-lockfile-because-pnpm-lockyaml-is-absent-in-pnpm):
- **Faster installations** - pnpm is generally faster than npm
- **Disk space efficiency** - pnpm uses hard links to save disk space
- **Strict dependency resolution** - Better handling of peer dependencies
- **Monorepo support** - Better workspace support

## Files Changed
- ✅ Generated `pnpm-lock.yaml` (138KB)
- ✅ Updated `SETUP.md` documentation
- ✅ Removed `package-lock.json`

## Testing Results
```bash
# Frozen lockfile test
$ rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
✅ Lockfile is up to date, resolution step is skipped
✅ Packages: +527 installed in 1.1s

# Build test  
$ pnpm run build
✅ Build completed successfully
```

## Action Items Completed
- [x] Removed npm lockfile and node_modules
- [x] Generated proper pnpm-lock.yaml
- [x] Verified frozen lockfile installation works
- [x] Updated documentation to use pnpm
- [x] Tested build process with pnpm

## Next Steps
1. **Commit the pnpm-lock.yaml file** to the repository
2. **Push changes** to fix GitHub Actions workflows
3. **Use pnpm for all future development** instead of npm
